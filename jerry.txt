She has remained afebrile and well-appearing, and her labs have been reassuring, making sepsis or bacteremia unlikely, and further work up is not necessary at this time. Most cases of mastitis are caused by staph aureus, and less commonly are caused by gram negative enteric organisms, anaerobes, or GBS. Her current antibiotic regimen is appropriate, and once her cultures are negative for 24 hours, we will be able to transition her to PO antibiotic treatment and hopefully send her home, given she continues to be afebrile and well-appearing.

Plan:  FEN/GI:  -Breastfeeding ad lib and supplement with formula as needed  -Monitor I/Os    Resp/CV:  -Hemodynamically stable  -CPM  -Vitals q 4 hour    ID:  -Continue on Clindamycin 5 mg/kg q 6 hours and Gentamycin 4 mg/kg q 24 hours  -F/U blood culture  -Monitor fever curve: if infant becomes febrile or clinical appearance worsens, would obtain an LP and consider starting on Ceftriaxone     Social:  -Will keep family up to date    Disposition:   Anticipated discharge date: Pending culture and clinical stability  Special discharge needs (formula changes, medical equipment, home-care, etc.): TBD  Follow-up appointments: PCP    Renee Boulware, MD R3 on 4/18/2017 at 2:40 PM    I saw and evaluated the patient. I agree with the resident's/fellow's findings and plan of care as documented above. Did well overnight and remains afebrile with good PO and normal UOP. No drainage.    Most likely this is neonatal mastitis secondary to a staph aureus infection (85% typically are), however we need to cover for e coli, salmonella, GBS, etc...given the age. If she spikes a fever, will need an LP. PE: comfortable, right breast with a 1 inch area of erythema and swelling, no drainage or obvious fluctuance. Will continue IV abx until cultures are negative at 36 hours and we start to see some improvement. Lactation consult per mom's request.     ERIC BIONDI, MD

    Department of Lactation and Breastfeeding Medicine    Congratulations on the birth of your baby and your decision to provide the benefits of breast milk.    Birth Weight:     Discharge: Weight: 3605 g (7 lb 15.2 oz)    Weight Change: Birth weight not on file from BW  Your infant is on the 40 percentile growth curve   At home, we try to do our best to mimic the routine your currently have in the NICU  · Feed your baby on demand about every 2-3 hours. Just like adults do not eat a meal each time they feed--neither do babies. Sometimes, like us, they want a snack and not a meal. When babies snack, expect that they will eat more often.  · Feeding Cues: Your baby's feeding cues are hand to mouth movements, stretching movements, making sounds, lip smacking, licking, and rapid eye movement under closed lids. Crying is a late cue, baby may need to be calmed before he/she will latch.  · Support breast milk production: We suggest that you continue to pump every time a bottle is placed into your child's mouth. You may use a bottle to 'top off' breastfeeds or in place of a feeding.   Remember to get a deep latch each time you breast feed.    Tips to get the deep latch:  In football hold bring baby around your body, nose to nipple, offer a big target with your other hand, when baby opens her mouth wide and drops her tongue bring her forward, up and over, and push your nipple into her mouth.  She should be so close that her nose is touching your breast.  Remember to stop if it feels painful because that is the sign that it is not a deep enough latch.  Offer her both breasts and remember to try to burp at end of the feed.  Feed olivia at the early signs of hunger as if you wait until she is crying she will be less patient to get a deep latch.  Feed at least every 3 hours unless she wants to feed more frequently.   Your doing great!!      Milk Storage:  Countertop, Table Room temperature up to 77 F 6-8 hours Containers should be covered and kept as cool as possible   Insulated cooler bag 5-39 F 24 hours Keep freezer packs in contact with milk containers, limit opening cooler bag   Refrigerator 39 F 5 days Store milk in back of the main body of the refrigerator   Freezer compartment of a refrigerator 5 F 2 weeks Store milk toward the back of the freezer where temperature is most constant.     Freezer compartment of a refrigerator with separate doors 0 F 3-6 months Milk stored for longer durations is safe but some of the lipids (fat) in the milk can degrade resulting in lower quality milk.   Chest or upright deep freezer -4 F 6-12 months    Reference: Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine (2004)      Follow up: The NICU Lactation Consultants are available at 585-275-1779 from 8 am to 2 pm daily. After hours you can leave a message at 585-275-7586 and it is checked daily.      Lynsey K Garver, RN  Lactation Consultant

Blood cultures were drawn to check for an infection in the blood and she was started on intravenous antibiotics. Once she remained without fever and her blood cultures were negative for 36 hours, we discharged her home with 5 additional days of antibiotics.   We think that this may have been breast tissue enlargement secondary to hormones, but sometimes this can be a risk factor for infection, so are treating it as such, especially because Olivia is so young.     Your instructions for your child:   -Please continue giving her antibiotics for the next 5 days       -Clindamycin every 6 hours (this next dose is due at 4 pm today)       -Cefuroxime every 8 hours (give her the first dose today at 2 pm)  -Follow up with your pediatrician.

Many of our patients and families have questions about Zika.  The following information will help you understand the basics of Zika and what it means for you.    What is Zika infection?   Zika infection is caused by the Zika virus. The virus is spread mostly by the bite of a certain type of mosquito. These mosquitoes bite during the day and at night.  Besides mosquitoes, how else does Zika spread?   ? A pregnant woman can give the infection to her unborn baby. This might cause serious birth defects.  ? One person with Zika infection can give the virus to another person through sex. This can happen even if the infected person has no signs of illness.  ? If you receive a blood transfusion from an infected person, you can get the infection.   Is there Zika virus in New York State?  ? Zika has been found only in people who were infected while traveling to Zika-affected areas, or by having sex with someone who had traveled to those areas.  So far, no one has gotten Zika infection from a mosquito bite in New York State.  ? Zika outbreaks have occurred in South and Central America, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Puerto Rico.  An outbreak also occurred in south Florida during the summer of 2016.  Many areas of the U.S. have mosquitoes that can spread Zika  What are the symptoms of Zika?  ? When Zika causes illness, it is usually mild. Most adults with Zika won’t even know they have it.  ? You may have a fever, rash, red eyes, and joint pains for several days.   ? PREGNANCY:  If a woman is infected during pregnancy, the Zika virus can be passed to the unborn baby. The illness can cause damage to the baby’s developing brain.  Microcephaly (having an abnormally small head) is one of the most serious birth defects caused by Zika.  What about traveling to an area with Zika?  ? If you are pregnant:   Do not travel to areas with Zika. If you must travel to an area with Zika, talk to your healthcare provider first and take steps to prevent mosquito bites during your trip.  ? If your partner is pregnant, and you have traveled to an area with Zika:   Use condoms correctly, every time you have sex, or do not have sex for the entire pregnancy.  ? If you and your partner are planning a pregnancy, and you have traveled to an area with Zika:  Talk with your healthcare provider before trying to become pregnant.  ? Zika Testing:  Any pregnant woman should be tested for Zika if she or her sexual partner has traveled to an area where Zika is found. You can ask for testing any time during your pregnan

I agree with the resident's/fellow's findings and plan of care as documented above. By the day of discharge Olivia's left sided breast "mass" was much smaller and was no longer red (measuring about 1.5 x 1.5 cm at this point). There was no fluctuance or drainage. I am less convinced at this point, given the quick resolution, age, and ultrasound of this being a mastitis and may instead be secondary to hormone shifts during breastfeeding. That said, it is prudent to continue antibiotics in this 2-week old infant. Of note, we obtained a renal ultrasound here as it was scheduled to be performed this week as an outpatient - please see the report but I expect the results suggest a normal physiologic variant. Mom knows she needs to seek medical care for any temps &gt; 100.4 and we had lactation see her here which provided some benefit to mom.     ERIC BIONDI, MD
