I was asked by APP to see this patient due to the complexity of the current medical presentation, due to diagnostic uncertainty and for assistance with physical exam findings.    I have reviewed and agree with the above documentation and, in addition, the history is notable for fussiness today with fever at PCP office by temporal thermometer--no antipyretics given, and spontaneous resolution of fever by the time he arrived here.  Feeding normally, normal UOP. Uneventful full-term birth by c-section, discharged at same time as mom, no known sick contacts among close contacts (many friends of mom/dad visited them who may have had minor symptoms).. Exam is notable for well appearing 22 day old, clear lungs, CV RRR w/o murmur, normal bowel sounds, well healing umbilicus with minor umbilical hernia that is easily reduced, normal circumcised penis, no diaper rash, B/L TMs normal, red reflex present, no intraoral rash. Patient is at risk for URI, UTI, bacteremia, less likely meningitis (no fever here and no rectal or axillary temp at PCP, well appearing, normal feeding, no emesis). Our plan is labs, blood cultures, PO trial, holding off on LP at this time per REVISE protocol for fever in 7-60 day old infant, admission for observation off antibiotics..

Patient has no known medical problems except repaired ankyloglossia and has been doing well at home.    Patient is admitted for observation after a fever (101.7 via temporal artery thermometer) was noted at PCP's office after evaluation for primary symptom of fussiness.  Patient has seemed less consolable today than prior, no other specific or localizing symptoms.  ED did BMP, CBC, BCx, UA, UCx, and RVP; results so far are reassuring.  Infant is well appearing and afebrile in our ED.    Plan to admit for observation of clinical status and wait on blood cultures.

Mom had brought him into PCP for concern of fussiness. Mom has been having diarrhea the last 2days. His stools have also been looser; he has been voiding without stooling, no blood or mucous in stool, no abdominal pain, no emesis, he's been breastfeeding well the entire time.

If he has another episode would send for rotavirus. He does not have markers of a serious bacterial infection on his CBC. He has not had a rectal temp greater than 100.8. Plan will be to watch blood cx for 24hrs and if negative, d/c home this evening. Should see PCP when office is next open to be sure hydration status is appropriate even if diarrhea continues.reviewed signs of dehydration with mom and other symptoms she should be concerned about (pain, inconsolable, rectal temp greater than 100.4, unable to tolerate feeds, bloody stools, etc).
